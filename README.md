# ECGAuthCNN
A convolutional neural network approach to using electrocardiogram data for the purpose of authentication.
Research project looking at a possible way of authentication in implanted medical devices using a convolutional neural network. The data is provided from the MIT-BIH heart arrhythmia database. 
The primary purpose is to compare with a similar implemenation utilizing a recurrent neural network instead.
